DogArray
#######################

DogArrays are re-sizable arrays with implementations available for primitive types and generic objects. Internally
it uses an array that can be directly accessed. The name DogArray comes from the library name and was selected since
just about every permutation on growable array conflicted with an existing library. Plus who doesn't like dogs?
